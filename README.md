## About Me

I'm a passionate developer who loves building web applications and understanding how things work under the hood. Currently diving deep into low-level programming because there's something magical about understanding what happens beneath the abstractions.

```python
class Developer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "Hadi Alam"
        self.current_focus = "Low-level programming & System internals"
        self.daily_driver = "Linux"
        self.loves = ["Clean code", "Efficient systems", "Good coffee"]
    
    def currently_learning(self):
        return ["System programming", "Computer architecture", "How things really work"]
```
